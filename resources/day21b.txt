-- if we jump to D then next is one of:
--   E to F
--   E to I
--   D to H
-- since there are two possibilities from the

NOT D J -- false if we'd consider jumping
OR F J  -- true if F is an option

OR I J  -- true if F or I is an option
        -- (or if we're not going to jump anyway)

AND D J -- true if we can jump with options

-- this part is from part 1
-- so we only jump if we need to, since
-- we can't see far enough ahead
-- to know if we should jump now or hold
NOT A T -- false if A is floor
NOT T T -- true if A is floor
AND B T -- true if B is also floor
AND C T -- true if C is also floor
NOT T T -- true if there's a hole ahead

-- only jump if there's a hole ahead
